<h2>For You</h2>

<p><b>Pama ly,</b> nothing special but I wnt you to know just how special you are to me.... </p>

<p>So,You should know how I feel for you padma, with you it feels like there nothing in this world to me, that matters more than you.With you I feel confident,  I feel loved and I feel like I am someone who matters.</p>
<p>I don't have to pretend around you. So I become a lil childish with you ,I feel safe enough to let my emotions out and say whatever is in my heart.</p>
<p>These days its like every little thing you do matters to me , my days start to depend on your mood,if it's good than I'm happy and if it's not , it feels like something is missing, I feel happy when you notice and admire the small things I do ,and I get upset knowing I did something you didn't like.</p>

<p>You alway say that "it's not your first time so you won't feel it special", but Iet me tell you why it will be special,I've never craved for a hug this much ,I've never wanted to hold someone's hand the way I want to hold yours. Yes, I've done these before but I've never craved for it,which I'm doing right now. I miss holding your hands.</p>

<p>Might feel weird to you, but I've kissed you so many time's when I missed you, (ofc your photo). While sleeping I imagine you next to me,I just close my eyes and I'm right next to you. I get a very nice feeling when I stare at your photos,its something special that I can't explain ,it just makes me happy, smile .</p>

<p>And I dream of us getting married one day, us staying together forever ,you and me being there for each other till the very end .</p>

<p><b>I love you, and I always will.</b></p>
